### Project #1: The DOM

## Attendance
There are no full day classes during project weeks, but we do expect you to be working on your project daily and be available during the usual class times (6:30pm - 10:45PM Eastern), for TA hours or any meetings with instructors as needed.

There are no classes during project week, except but you need to login and essentially spend all time in lab:

Saturday, Jan 29th: Project presentation day! You're required to be in the class zoom starting at 10:00 AM Eastern
Failure to make an attendance check will result in an unexcused absence for that day.

### Project Details
## Mandatory To Pass:
MVP - Minimum Viable Product
Your dom project must meet these requirements:

Built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (must be visual and use the DOM not the Console)
Hosted on Github pages
Commits to Github every day
A README.mdfile with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, a link to your live site, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc. 

 ## If you build a you Game must have:
1. Must be a two player game (either against the computer or against another player)
- Example: Blackjack: A player plays against the dealer. The dealer is the computer - Example: Connect Four: Two players pass the game between themselves to take turns

2. ## A win state - a way for the player to win the game

High score can be considered a win state

3. ## A lose state - a way for the player to lose the game

Example: Blackjack - a player must be able to lose all of their money with losing hands and cannot play if their bankroll is at 0
Example: Connect Four - the other player has won or there are no possible plays left

4. A way to keep playing if the game is not over

5. Multiple rounds to play - a round must begin, end, and there must be a way to check if the game should continue or the overall game is won or lost
- Example: Blackjack: a player takes turns playing a hand versus a computer - the player's hand can either win, lose or tie the dealer. If the player has enough money in their bankroll they can keep playing. A player must be able to win several rounds and increase their bankroll - Example: Connect Four: two (non-computer) players take turns adding chips to the board. The game will check if a player won or if the board is full and there are no more plays possible. A player gets four chips in a row (vertically or horizontally)- one person wins, one loses, there are no further plays in this case
