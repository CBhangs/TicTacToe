4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.

5. First to 5 wins 

### Project Details
## Mandatory To Pass:
MVP - Minimum Viable Product
Your dom project must meet these requirements:

Built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (must be visual and use the DOM not the Console)
Hosted on Github pages
Commits to Github every day
A README.mdfile with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, a link to your live site, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc. 


1. ## A win state - a way for the player to win the game

Get three "X" or three "O" in a row or column

2. ## A lose state - a way for the player to lose the game

When your opponite gets his/her x or o in a row or column
When you run out of spaces to place your move

3. A way to keep playing if the game is not over

4. Multiple rounds to play - a round must begin, end, and there must be a way to check if the game should continue or the overall game is won or lost
- Example: Blackjack: a player takes turns playing a hand versus a computer - the player's hand can either win, lose or tie the dealer. If the player has enough money in their bankroll they can keep playing. A player must be able to win several rounds and increase their bankroll - Example: Connect Four: two (non-computer) players take turns adding chips to the board. The game will check if a player won or if the board is full and there are no more plays possible. A player gets four chips in a row (vertically or horizontally)- one person wins, one loses, there are no further plays in this case
